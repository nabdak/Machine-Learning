# Supervised Machine Learning: Classification 

## 1. Logistic Regression

## 2. K-Nearest Neighbors

## 3. Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Kernel SVMs
## 4. Decision Trees
## 5. Ensemble Methods, Bagging and Random Forests
Forked version used another dataset that is to be read from a csv file. In addition, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f1, and RoC analysis was added to each algorithm to provide the needed statistics which can help in comparisons.     

## 6. Boosting and Stacking
